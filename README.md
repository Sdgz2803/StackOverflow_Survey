# **A Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project**

---
This project demonstrates an exploratory data analysis (EDA) with the goal of complementing my previous project, in which I used a discontinued dataset of job postings from the platform Glassdoor. In this project, some of the key questions I attempted to address in the last analysis could not be developed due to missing data. Specifically, the compensation column in the dataset had a significant amount of missing data, with 48.5% of the values unavailable. Given the extent of the missing information, any analysis of compensation trends or patterns could lead to skewed or unreliable results. For this reason, I have chosen not to address this question in order to maintain the integrity and accuracy of the analysis. Instead, I focused on answering five other questions as part of this EDA.

## **Features**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize skills demand, industry insights and other key trends.
- **Visualizations**: Includes plots for better storytelling.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing and inconsistent data to improve analysis quality.

## **Key Insights**
- **Salary Trends**: The compensation column has 48.5% missing values, which could lead to a skewed analysis.  
- **Skills Demand**: JavaScript and Python are the most sought-after skills, followed by HTML/CSS leanguages.  
- **Methods of learning**:Most developers, despite having a university degree, have learned a significant amount through self-learning, tutorials, or documentation found on the web.
